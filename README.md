### ✌ Hello!

This repository contains the implementations of the most used data structures, written in Python, implemented during the Data Structure discipline at IFRN.

Currently, the following structures are included:

- Stack
- Queue
- Double-ended Queue
- Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Direct Address Table
- Hash Table

The structures are being added as they are being implemented, if you still don't have one you need, wait a while. 😁
